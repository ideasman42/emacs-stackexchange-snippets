Emacs StackExchange Snippets
****************************

This repository is to keep an up-to-date list of useful snippets
which are too small for packages,
but inconvenient to manually copy/paste into your configuration.

In this repository snippets must:

- Be self contained (no interdependence's).
- Use a common prefix so as not to pollute name-space (recipes can ensure this).

Usage

In progress.

TODO
